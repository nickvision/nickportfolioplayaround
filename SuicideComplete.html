    <strong>Advocating a Stoic View on Suicide</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    “There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide”
</p>
<p align="center">
    -Camus, <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>
</p>
<p>
    Whether we should ever commit suicide represents a fundamental and important question for all our lives. Suicide as a philosophical topic throws up
    countless questions from whether it is a fundamental sin or a fundamental right, or whether it is always morally wrong, sometimes morally wrong, or never
    morally wrong? It even throws up questions as to what we mean when we talk of suicide – are we talking only of those emotion-filled violent deaths that are
    often regretted by others or also of the calm self-sacrificing deaths that are sometimes celebrated? Examining suicide forces us to tackle the question of
    the meaning of our own existence and whether it is ever right to end it. Can such a choice ever be made rationally, and is rationality alone enough to say
    a suicide was correct or just?
</p>
<p>
    Treatment of suicide has varied throughout human history, and in the west a variety of views have been recorded and expressed on whether it is ever
    acceptable, from the endorsement of suicide in certain circumstances (though not all) in ancient Greece and Rome, to the equation of suicide as the
    ultimate sin<em> </em>from the writings of Augustine and Aquinas in the Christian tradition. Views outside the west provide similar contrasts, from the
    endorsement of suicide in the Bushido tradition in Japan to its acceptance in certain strands in Buddhism to its rejection in other strands (Battin 2005:
    170).
</p>
<p>
    In this dissertation I will tackle the key questions necessary to establish a coherent view on suicide. For that view I will be revisiting the positions
    held by the ancient Stoics, with a specific attention given to the views of Seneca on suicide. I will combine and update these views with the modern
    dialogue on the definition, rationality and right to suicide to arrive at a current justification of the Stoic position. I will propose two interlinked
    views on suicide, one that I feel that will brook less argument - that there can be such a thing as a rational suicide; and the second more controversial -
    that suicide can be both advisable and represent the ultimate act of freedom for the rational person. I recognise by adopting a Stoic influenced view of
    suicide I am committing myself to some potentially strange metaphysical positions, however my focus for discussion for this dissertation is not the
    metaphysics but ethics so in the interests of space I will not be addressing those potential issues here.
</p>
<p>
    In the interests of focus I will not be dealing with the complex issues surrounding physician-assisted suicide and related matters, but only the cases
    where death is caused by the agent themselves. I will also not at length be examining the theological views from a Christian stand-point as my argument
will not appeal to any religious context, and these views have been argued against, in my view successfully, many times, most notably by Hume in his essay    <em>On The Naturalness of Suicide</em>.
</p>
<p>
    There are many potential objections to the view I will present, and due to the huge scope of the issue I will not have the space to tackle them all within
    this dissertation. Instead I will look at one key argument for the impossibility of suicide and discuss a reinterpretation that could support the Stoic
    position. My aim in this dissertation is to create an updated, credible Stoic view on whether and when it is acceptable to commit suicide.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Defining Suicide</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Before we can enter into fuller discussions on the rationality of suicide, it must first be determined what types of death we are talking about when we
    discuss suicide. On the face of it a natural definition would seem to be that suicide is any death both willed and caused by the agent; however this simple
    definition has often been disputed.
</p>
<p>
    Suicide by its very definition has a negative connotation in western society - the fact that we are always guilty of ‘committing’ suicide, a term most
    commonly used when referring to a criminal act, highlights this. The Christian moral tradition certainly stands as a staunch opponent of suicide, wherein
    it is defined as a ‘mortal sin’, being against nature and against the supposed will of God to take one’s own life(Aquinas <em>Summa Theologiae </em>2a2ae,
    question 64, article 5). Even beyond this, suicide and by extension the question of our own mortality are issues that are uncomfortable for many people,
    and we find that in the modern medical profession suicidal wishes are often viewed almost exclusively as a symptom of significant mental illness(Veith
    1970: 12). Due to these factors and others many have sought to narrow the definition of suicide to include self-caused deaths in only select circumstances,
    which I believe to be an error.
</p>
<p>
    Chiefly highlighted under this are the cases of so-called self-sacrificing deaths (such as the soldier who throws himself on a live grenade to protect the
    lives of his fellow soldiers), which are often defined not as suicides due to their altruistic nature and arguably positive social and/or moral outcomes,
    as Margolis (1978) puts it:
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “the Buddhist monk who sets fire to himself in order to protest the war that he might have resisted in another way will not be said to have suicided if
        the overriding characterisation of what he did fixes on the ulterior objective of having influenced his countrymen. But he may have been said to have
        suicided if resisting the war and influencing his countrymen are judged not to bear on what, all things considered, proved to be the overriding
        characterisation of what he did.”
    </em>
    (Margolis 1978: 95)
</p>
<p>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    However to me this seems an uncomfortable and questionable distinction; in either case the Monk’s intention was surely to take an action that would lead to
    the end of his life. It seems strange to say that based on the supposed<em> overriding</em> reason for his death, it can make his case a suicide or not,
    especially as the means of judging what the overriding characterization was in such cases appears purely subjective. If a man appears to sacrifice himself
    in the name of a great cause (perhaps due to the timing/nature/location of the suicide) and is celebrated for it, but in truth, unknown to us, he killed
    himself over a lost lover, does it make his case a suicide or not? Surely basing whether someone has committed suicide or not purely on how it is viewed by
    the general public, as Margolis seems to necessarily have to say, is a flawed distinction. I would argue that all suicides by their very nature have some
    ulterior purpose in mind, even what we will deem so-called irrational suicides are usually committed in the hope of relieving some pressure, such as those
    associated with extreme depression or anxiety, or proving some point, even if the point is one that we would not usally admire, for instance such as
    revenging/causing guilt on a lover who jilted them. Even if we do term these suicides irrational for various reasons, they do not seem distinct in their
    basic elements from the grenade jumper or the Buddhist monk. In each case an agent wants to accomplish a goal, subjectively positive or negative as it may
    be, and decides to take an action to this end that the agent knows entails the ending of the agent’s life as a necessary condition of this goal. I would
    argue that on this basis both types of case can be classed as fundamentally the same act, that of suicide, irrelevant of any perceived higher
    purpose/goals, which once again we do not seem to have very good tools for distinguishing between the two.
</p>
<p>
    Do we then need to revisit our definition of suicide? An influential definition is given by Emile Durkheim when he says ‘Suicide is applied to all cases of
    death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act of the victim himself, which he knows will produce this result.’(Durkheim 1951: 44).
    This definition however is somewhat problematic. For instance a smoker, at least in modern times, well knows the dangers and diseases that can be caused by
    smoking, and surely knows that such diseases may cause him to die, but if he does dies from lung cancer caused by smoking, has he really committed suicide?
    Under Durkheim’s definition as it is given here (his fuller definition was admittedly more nuanced) we would have to probably say yes, but this seems
    counterintuitive, there seems no particular want on the part of the smoker to die purely in light of being a smoker. We can hardly say that over 30 years
    of smoking, he was really making an attempt on his life each time he lit a cigarette. It seems then we need to add something to the above definition to
    truly define suicide.
</p>
<p>
    Let us say then suicide is where the death is firstly fully<em> intended</em> by the agent, and secondly <em>caused directly</em> by actions of the agent
    that thirdly the agent believes <em>will result </em>in death, regardless of the underlying motivation. Thus the smoker escapes as a non-suicide as he does
    not deliberately intend his death by smoking.
</p>
<p>
    There are two other potentially problematic types of cases for the above definition that I shall now deal with. Firstly there is the case of persons who
    take suicidal or near-suicidal actions in the name of sport or pleasure. Examples of this may be the helicopter skier who skis down avalanche-risk
    mountains, or the motorbike stuntman/daredevil or any variety of extreme sports enthusiasts. While their actions may be casually described as suicidal or
    near suicidal in the media and public opinion, I would say these cases are not in fact problematic for the above given definition of suicide. While their
    actions can well be argued as extremely dangerous, they are not suicidal per se as killing themselves is never the intention, the intention instead being
    to achieve the seemingly impossible, challenge themselves, or to get the greatest thrill available to them; though they risk death, death is not their
    intention. True, it could well be argued that such people perhaps value their lives less highly than others, but to describe their deaths as a result of
    their actions as suicides would be incorrect. They do not view death as a necessary outcome of their actions, thus they are not choosing to die
    intentionally and, under our definition, therefore do not count as suicides.
</p>
<p>
    The second case is that of so-called coerced deaths, where the person in question is given the choice whether to either take action to kill himself
    wilfully or else, as is made clear to him, he will be killed by another against his will (whether another person, the state etc. is not of essential
    importance here). Is such a case, whether the person chooses to kill themselves or not the outcome is the same: namely death. Perhaps the most famous case
    is that of Socrates, who was ordered to drink Hemlock by the Athenian court as a fatal punishment for his perceived crimes. Duff (1982) and Holland (1980)
    put together a well-considered case for why we should perhaps question whether we should judge the death of Socrates a true suicide, with Duff unsure and
    Holland going further by asserting ‘Taking hemlock does not, in the context of an Athenian judicial execution, amount to slaughtering oneself: in this
    circumstance it is no more an act of suicide than the condemned man's walk to the scaffold’(Holland 1980: 1460). The emphasis then is that given the nature
    of the Athenian judicial system, the drinking of Hemlock is wholly an execution, and Socrates is complying with it out of necessity, not through choice,
    just as the prisoner who walks willingly to the scaffold does so out of necessity, not genuine choice.
</p>
<p>
However I believe this is in fact not true in the case of Socrates for two key reasons. Firstly I would disagree with Holland and say the case of Socrates    <em>willingly</em> drinking the hemlock as he did<em> is</em> fundamentally different to the condemned man’s walk, as when it comes down to it Socrates is
    still actively performing the act of killing himself with the full knowledge of what he is doing, while in the second case it is a separate person that
    kills the condemned man, so it cannot be said to be his own action. Based on our earlier definition of suicide, Socrates satisfies the premises of the
    definition while the condemned man's death is not caused directly by his own action, his action is merely to walk, it is the action of the other person
    that causes his death, and so does not fulfil the premises for our definition of suicide. The second point I would raise is that Socrates in fact does have
    a choice other than death. In the <em>Crito</em> it is made quite clear that he has the option of escape as he is told in no uncertain terms that he has
friends who are willing to help him, has allies in another City, and has the necessary finances at his disposal to make an effective escape (Plato    <em>Crito </em>45). Despite knowing this, Socrates refuses Crito and instead determines to stay and await his appointed time of suicide. Socrates is
    choosing very clearly here to die, when he has the viable option of further life; in fact he states in the Phaedo that he is deliberately doing so to
    honour and show respect for the law(Plato <em>Phaedo </em>103). It can be said then that Socrates intends and willingly chooses to take an action that will
    cause his death by his own hand, firstly by not escaping, and secondly by actively drinking the hemlock. Thus it is clear that even if we perceive Socrates
    death as coerced, under our earlier definition he has indeed committed suicide, especially in light of the fact that escape was a viable option.
</p>
<p>
    A similar case exists in the death of Seneca, which is famed as one of the great examples of a Stoic suicide. Late in his life Seneca was condemned to die
    by the Emperor Nero due to his supposed part in plotting against the Emperor, who had at one stage actually been Seneca’s pupil. Whether there was any
    truth in the allegations is uncertain, the point is Seneca was faced with a simple choice – kill himself that night or be killed by Nero’s soldiers in the
    morning. Faced with this, Seneca choose to end his own life by opening his veins. In this case I maintain Seneca <em>choose </em>to end his own life by his
    own hand, in accordance with Stoic philosophy and his beliefs. Though he had no option but to die, it takes significant strength of character to take one’s
    own life without complaint, and arguably such an action has its own moral value created by choosing to end one’s life freely rather than comply with (and
    thereby potentially endorse) an unjust execution, an idea I will discuss more later. If we accept dying by your own hand in protest to an unjust execution
    has a positive moral value, then a coerced death of this nature has a different complexion. True the choice remains between death and death, but one death
    allows a higher moral position than the other – that of taking one’s own life and making a moral/political statement rather than consenting to, and thereby
    arguably endorsing or at least not actively protesting, your execution at the hands of another. In such cases I would suggest than there can be a
    significant moral difference between killing yourself or having another kill you, and as such we must call the first set of deaths suicides, and the second
    set executions.
</p>
<p>
    After such examinations than I believe the earlier definition of suicide as ‘a death that is fully<em> intended</em> by the agent, <em>caused directly</em>
    by actions of the agent and that the agent believes <em>will result </em>in death’ stands up to scrutiny, and it is this definition I will be using hereon
    whenever I refer to suicide.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Can There Be Such a Thing as a Rational Suicide?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The view that I am advancing in this dissertation is based on the conception that there is such a thing as a rational suicide. Not only this, but the
    contention that there are suicides which more than being understandable, are also praiseworthy. First though the very concept of a ‘rational’ suicide has
    been in modern times often disputed and is, at least in the medical world, in the main part viewed with suspicion if not total rejection. The issues I will
    address in this section stand as necessary foundations for the Stoic influenced view of suicide I will present, that takes as its basis point the
    contention that rational suicide is possible. While for much of the last two thousand years arguments against suicide have been largely theological, in
    recent times arguments against suicide have moved on to two main forums – the medical and the philosophical. I will deal with each in turn to provide a
    definition and justification of rational suicide.
</p>
<p>
    What firstly do we mean by a rational suicide? One simple but effective definition is given by Mayo (1986) who states it is someone who ‘has good reason to
    believe his interests are better served dying sooner rather than later’(Mayo 1986: 145). This is based on two fundamental conceptions that I think are
    generally uncontroversial: that death at some point is an inevitability for everyone, suicide is merely an advancing of this fact; and second, that while
    it can be argued that life in general can be seen as a good, there are clearly some lives that are not good and marked by much suffering and unhappiness,
    such as those who suffer from painful terminal illnesses.
</p>
<p>
    Brandt (1975, 1980) sets out much of the criteria needed to judge how a suicide can be rational for the person making the decision. The focus is that the
    person in question needs to examine to the best of their ability and with sound judgement the future worldcourses, that is to say how events in the world
    are likely to go, firstly in what will be the likely outcome should they commit suicide now, and the possible outcomes should they continue to live, and
    judge which better serves their fundamental interests. This stress on worldcourses as opposed to purely self-interested decisions is important as it must
    be acknowledged we do not exist in a vacuum. Unless we live the life of a hermit, our death is likely to have some impact on the world in terms of the
    feelings and interests of our loves ones, colleagues, and even acquaintances. I think it would be too narrow a view to take that these consequences need
    always be negative or overwhelming. It might serve our personal interests so greatly to die rather than live on that this outweighs the considerable harm
    it might cause to our friends and family. Likewise if we are ill we might conversely be reducing a significant financial and time burden on our family by
    ending our life sooner rather than later. Though they may be unlikely to feel that way at the time, a worldcourse where they are financially more secure
    but living with you for less time may be more positive given time than one with your continued existence, especially if your quality of life or interaction
    was bound to suffer. Despite this I think it is worth stressing that the determinant in the worldcourse choosing has still got to be focused fully on the
    individual’s interests for whose life is in question; it would be wrong for us, as may be the temptation, to weight the concerns and feelings of others
    always over our own regardless of situation. Self-interest must come to the fore in any decision as there is nothing that we have more ownership over than
    our own lives.
</p>
<p>
    There is admittedly an inherent difficulty with independently determining someone’s grasp on rationality, especially in a case such as when they are
    considering suicide. I think the judgement must then be based on if the agent’s decision to suicide is firstly consistent with accurate beliefs about
    themselves and the world, and secondly with their own core values. The reason for this becomes clear when we look at the mental illness or medical argument
    for suicide being irrational.
</p>
<p>
    The general modern medical position is that suicidal thoughts are in a sense of pathological – that is to say symptomatic of mental illness. The fact that
    someone is even considering suicide is generally taken as a suggestion of mental illness, and psychiatric review urged(Veith 1970: 12, Mayo 1986: 148). The
    view as it stands can be attacked for being an oversimplification and falsifiable – if there can be a case of one person who has no demonstrable mental
    illness that commits suicide based on apparently rational grounds, then it is hard to see how suicide can always be said to be a product of mental illness.
    Examples of just such cases are many, from terminally ill patients in the current day to historical examples such as the sacrificial suicide of Lawrence
    Oates in the Arctic to the suicides of Cato and Seneca, which we will discuss in more detail later. Where the view has undoubtedly come from and from where
    it draws its considerable strength is that the majority of suicides appear to be irrational by most judgements, and often these involve some form of
    temporary or permanent mental illness. Many of these suicides fail to be rational as a result of their failure of the first of the two requirements I
    outlined in the previous paragraph - the holding of accurate beliefs about themselves and the world. As Brandt points out, a large number of suicides are
    the result of moments of despair, that while their effect may not be permanent, have such an impact that the person suffering from them cannot envisage a
    future without feeling that way(Brandt 1980: 127). In many cases this is evidence of holding an incorrect belief about the world and their future within
    it, which compromises their ability to think rationally about future worldcourses in which they do not die. The famous saying that ‘suicide is a permanent
    solution to a temporary problem’ does hold some intuitive value in these cases, and there are many cases of those who are prevented from suicide who go on
    at a later date to thank those who prevented them as they once again have an enjoyable life that they would not have realised had they been allowed to
    commit suicide.
</p>
<p>
    Prolonged depression can similarly lead a person to incorrect views about future worldcourses and the permanence of their own depressed feelings. Another
    common incident is that in imagining his suicide, the person committing suicide imagines he will be around to experience the results of his suicide – the
    upset, the regrets, etc. that he wanted to inspire in others by killing himself in the first place. Clearly the thought that he will have the perceived
    benefit of witnessing these experiences is incorrect and features a fundamental flaw in reasoning. These cases are irrational as they are also based off
    false beliefs. However just because these may represent the majority of cases, which we rightly view as tragic, to discount every suicide as evidence of
    mental illness seems no more than an ingrained prejudice in both our general and medical culture, and one that does not stand up to scrutiny as there are
    many counter-examples, the most obvious being those who are terminally ill and who wish to avoid unnecessary suffering. If these suicides can be rational
    and understandable without recourse or reference to any mental illness, than the medical argument that suicide is always symptomatic of mental illness
    fails. I am of course arguing that suicides can be rational not only in cases of such illnesses, but these as examples seem sufficient to defeat the
    medical/mental illness argument that all suicides are irrational as they are a result of mental illness.
</p>
<p>
    The second key argument against the concept of rational suicide is a philosophical argument as presented by Devine (1980), among others. The argument runs
    that to make a rational choice we have to have knowledge of what we are choosing, either through our own experience or through the trusted testimony of
    others. As we can have no direct experience or testimony of death, it can never be a rational choice to choose it(Devine 1980: 139). Devine claims that
    this argument is not aided by knowledge of what one aims to escape by death, as ‘rational choice between two alternatives requires knowledge of
    both’(Devine 1980: 139). Though on the face of it this argument is potentially appealing there are several things wrong with it.
</p>
<p>
    In the first place if we follow the argument’s reasoning it seems to assert that just as we can’t rationally choose to die, lacking as we do proper
    knowledge of what that would be like, we can’t by the same token rationally choose to live – the choice to live is also between the known which is life
    (and the extent of accurate knowledge we have about any future life is always in itself questionable), and the unknown which is death, making the choice
    effectively the same between the two alternatives, an unknown and a known and just as irrational.
</p>
<p>
    A potential response could be that it takes making a decision (construed by the argument in play as irrational) to die, while living is the natural
    position, so no irrational choice needs to be made to live - it is just the way of things. The fact that we need to regularly eat and drink to stave off
    death should show such a response as incorrect. If anything, death is the natural and only inevitable outcome, and according to this argument it could be
    said we make an irrational choice to live every day by actively seeking to meet our nutritional requirements and prolong our existence.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly even if this first point was not clear, this argument seems to denigrate our whole conception of what rationality is by demanding too high a
    standard. Rarely if ever do we have strong knowledge of the two possible outcomes in many choice dependent situations in life – we work on predictions and
    sometimes will even prefer an unknowable outcome choice to a choice we have made before that has had a negative outcome; to make such a judgement does not
    seem inherently irrational. If we believe perfect or almost perfect knowledge is needed to make a choice rational, it seems nearly no major decisions we
    make are rational at all, the concept of rationality becomes obscure, an unsatisfactory outcome. On these two counts this argument against the rationality
    of suicide fails.
</p>
<p>
    Insight can be drawn from this defence though as we can conclude, as Mayo does, that rational suicide clearly does not need ‘perfect knowledge’; what it
    needs is that the person act according to the best evidence currently available to them that is not subject to obviously false beliefs, and that is
    consistent with what they hold to be their fundamental values and interests. If someone can satisfy these two requirements and therefore effectively
    picture the worldcourses if they do or do not suicide, if they act they can be said to have rationally committed suicide. Therefore, as the essential
    underpinning of my argument we can see that suicide can be rational. In the next section I will explore Stoic philosophy and their specific views on
    suicide to draw out the view that I will be proposing.

    <strong>Toward a Stoic View on Suicide</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Stoicism was one of the most influential schools of ancient philosophy in both the Greek and Roman worlds, and among its many remarkable and often
    controversial views perhaps it is Stoicism’s position on suicide that has elicited most attention; namely the view that as well as being morally
    permissible, suicide can also often been morally praiseworthy and a correct course of action. It is this view, updated with modern thinking on suicide,
    rights, and freedom that I advance and develop in this dissertation.
</p>
<p>
    When discussing Stoic views on suicide it is important to keep in mind four key tenets or conceptions of their philosophy that inform their view. Before
    discussing those it is worth noting that the Stoics tend to couch their philosophy on two levels, that of the ‘wise man’, ‘sapiens' or ‘sage’, and that of
    the ‘fool’ – usually characterised as the normal person. We should, according to the Stoics, all aim at emulating and following the sage, and seek to
    become him, but extant examples are not very common. Those who are closest to being characterised as sages in Stoic philosophy being cheifly Socrates and
    Cato the Younger, notably in the works of Seneca. The sage is seen for the Stoics as the perfect embodiment of reason, and accordingly, virtue; this is
    crucial as it is often postulated by Stoicism what the sage would do in given situations when trying to determine the rightness or wrongness of an action.
</p>
<p>
    First to consider is the view that the only good is virtue and the only bad is vice, everything else, from having an even or odd number of hairs on your
    head, to wealth, to the stretching or contracting of a finger, to even life itself, are<em> indifferents</em>, being neither good nor bad within
    themselves(Diogenes Laertius 7.104-5). To be sure, for the Stoics as for us, some of these are clearly more important than others and can often be
    categorised as either <em>to be preferred </em>or <em>to be avoided</em>. For instance, clearly health is to be preferred to illness, and thus each
    property has for the Stoics an inherent selective or rejective value, but this preferred status does still not render them goods in themselves. ‘Good’ as
    it exists can be found only through virtue(Stobaeus <em>Anthology </em><em>2.7)</em>. Therefore we find most things to be preferred or avoided
    indifferents, which hold no moral value within themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Along with this comes the concept of 'proper functions'. That is to say actions related to indifferents can be conducted in either a way that is
    appropriate or inappropriate to our nature, and a proper function is defined as something that which when “once it has been done, has a reasonable
    justification”(Stobaeus <em>Anthology</em> 2.85.13). Life itself for the Stoics is an indifferent, having no virtue or vice inherent in its nature, and
    though an important indifferent that usually is to be preferred, the suggestion is made that if there were a reasonable justification to end that life,
    then it could well be advisable, and perhaps in certain circumstances even required of an individual. We will explore this point further later on.
</p>
<p>
    Second is the definition of what is virtuous and good. This is defined in two interlinked concepts - living in accordance with nature, and living in
    accordance with reason. In fact for the Stoics these concepts are to all purposes identical, as to live reasonably is to live in agreement with
    nature(Stobaeus <em>Anthology </em>2.7). Reason itself however is distinct in some way as it is a facet bestowed by nature on man alone, and is the best
    part of man; in fact, perfect reason is clearly associated by Seneca with the divine(Seneca <em>Ep </em>76.9). Ultimate virtue and ultimate reason are
    morally and conceptually equivalent for the Stoics, as vice is likewise viewed as immoral and unreasonable, being against nature.
</p>
<p>
    The third is that while the Stoics define happiness as the ultimate end and point of life (Stobeaus <em>Anthology</em> 2.77), this happiness is quite
    distinct from the Aristotelian conception as it is defined completely and only as 'living according to virtue'. Only the virtuous life can be happy, and
    all it needs to be happy is to be virtuous, while an unvirtuous life cannot by definition be considered a happy life(Diogenes Laertius 7.88).
</p>
<p>
    The final related position to consider is that for the Stoics how long a life is lived has no independent value in the grand scheme of things – a short
    life of virtue is equally as valuable as a longer life of virtue, what matters is the possession of virtue and reason, as those are the lone determiners of
    happiness(Cicero: <em>De Finibus 3.46)</em>. Therefore thoughts of longevity are largely irrelevant for the Stoic on the consideration of whether to
    continue one's life. This may at first hand seem odd but I would argue otherwise. I would maintain that length is far from being the key determinable of
    what makes a life worthwhile. For instance a long life of say ninety years that is marked by an excessive amount of misery does not seem necessarily better
    than a considerably shorter but happier life of forty years; in fact quite the opposite. Though a long life is often viewed positively, this is usually due
    to the fact that a long life allows greater opportunity for achievements and pleasurable experiences, so we associate the two. Under many accounts of
    happiness it is the positive achievements and pleasurable experiences of a life that makes the life worthwhile; the length of the life in itself doesn’t
    hold much objective value, only the opportunity it affords the liver. It is not unthinkable that if a life were to continue to forty successfully and then
    end, we would find that life preferable to the same life, identical up to the age of forty, but that continued to the age of fifty but in which those next
    ten years featured nothing but failure and depression, or even just a significantly greater amount of failure and negativity than thereto experienced. Mere
    extra experience does not seem enough to give value on its own, it is the nature and quality of that experience that gives value to a life - that makes
    that extra experience beneficial. Therefore if the amount of virtue and happiness contained in a life between one that is fifty years long and one that is
    ninety years long is <em>equivalent</em> (in which the ninety year life may contain more happiness overall, but it is more spread-out and less frequent) it
    does not seem unreasonable to judge them as equals, as the Stoics certainly would have us do.
</p>
<p>
    Another related consideration is that of the autonomy of a life – how much the person living that life is in control of their own decisions and life, the
    upshot of this being the central Stoic position towards suicide that if a person can reasonably see their life is going to be in the future considerably
    unhappy or full of vice/devoid of virtue, or one that will see the removal of their control, through illness or some sort of slavery or other loss of
    autonomy, even a pampered slavery, then it is reasonable for that person to end their life before those negative circumstances come about.
</p>
<p>
    As far as the Greek founders of the early Stoa, there is little to no writing on the subject of suicide, leading some to suggest that they had little
    interest in the subject(Rist 1969). However despite this a large number of the early Stoic philosophers are known to have committed suicide, including the
    founder of Stoicism, Zeno, and his successor Cleanthes, suggesting that if not a core tenet, it was at least an acceptable practise.
</p>
<p>
    This omission disappears with the later Roman Stoa, with the writings of Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Musonius Rufus and most notably Seneca all discussing
    suicide in some form and generally their approach and treatment of the topic is similar. Both Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius stress that suicide is a
    reasonable option open to the wise man, and Aurelius often seems to echo the sentiments of Epictetus directly. For instance both refer to the example of a
    smoky room: "Has someone made smoke in the house? If it is moderate, I will stay; if too much, I go outside. For you must always remember and hold fast to
this, that the door is open" (Epictetus 1.25.18), stressing that if life becomes too unpleasant, there is always the option to end it(Aurelius    <em>Meditations </em>5.29). Aurelius also suggests that if you look to be losing control of yourself, it is reasonable and praiseworthy if you cannot
regain control, to make your exit without anger and simply and freely, and thereby earn honour by having made your exit in such a way(Aurelius    <em>Meditations </em>10.8).
</p>
<p>
    Where these writers appear to differ with Seneca, who I shall discuss next, is at what sign the wise man should take when deciding to end his life. Whereas
    at times Aurelius and Epictetus echo the ancient cynic view of ‘reason or the rope’ - that if life becomes unbearable then we should rightly end it, in
    other passages they suggest that the Stoic will wait for a due signal from god or the divine on when to kill himself(Epictetus 4.7.31). However at other
    times Epictetus seems to posit the choice purely on the individual, once suggesting conversely that he would rather kill himself then be forced to cut off
    his own beard(Epictetus 4.10.27). Clearly there are some integral inconsistencies in the views on suicide as expressed through these writers. These
    inconsistencies are largely resolved in the work of Seneca, who moves suicide from the divinely appointed fate of the wise man to something that can both
    be reasonably available to all men and can in fact be seen as potentially the defining virtuous act of their lives.
</p>
<p>
    Seneca discusses suicide several times in his<em> </em>writings,<em> </em>but perhaps the most thorough treatment is in Epistle LXX, entitled 'On the
    Proper Time to Slip the Cable'. In this epistle Seneca upholds the principle tenets of Stoicism I outlined earlier, relating them specifically to the
    subject of suicide. He states that the wise man will always focus on the quality rather the quantity of his life, for 'mere living is not a good, but
    living well'(Seneca <em>Ep. </em>70.2). He claims that the sage will always look for the proper time to end his life, and look to die well, as a direct
    escape from living ill (Seneca <em>Ep. </em>70.3). He notes that death is inevitable, and as such we should not hide from it, fear it, or complain if it
    claims us earlier than others(Seneca <em>Ep. </em>70.1). Seneca is also interesting in this passage as he states his view that, unlike much of Stoic
    philosophy, the exit of rational suicide is not open only to the sage but to the ordinary man as well, praising a slave gladiator who choked himself to
    death on a wash stick rather than suffer the indignity of the fighting pits, suggesting that even the apparently lowest of men can honour himself by
committing a rational suicide(Seneca <em>Ep. </em>70.5). This theme is repeated with other examples in this passage and within his other writings(Seneca    <em>Ep.</em> 70.9, 104.21, <em>De Prov. </em>6.4-7).
</p>
<p>
    Seneca's account differs in some key ways from that of the other Stoic writers; firstly upon the question of when to commit suicide, and secondly on the
    nature of the association between suicide and freedom. While previous Stoics at times stressed the need to have some divine signal to end one’s life,
    Seneca removes all mention of that and places the focus purely on the individual and his own decision-making. The second notion that Seneca ties into this
    is that not only is it down to the individual, and at that, any individual, to make the decision on when to end his life, but also that this choice
    represents perhaps the greatest act of freedom open to any individual can - the ultimate rejection of external authority and/or internal pressure. He
    repeatedly states that suicide offers the constant and ultimate approaching point to freedom saying ‘no one can be held in life’, ‘there are many gates to
freedom open’ (Seneca <em>Ep.</em> 12.10) and that the way out is always open, so why fight if you do not want to, when you can fly? (Seneca    <em>De Prov. </em>6.7). He cites Zeno as an example of someone who wisely choose to die, not through any external forces, but because he decided to die
‘before necessity’ arose that he should(Seneca <em>Ep.</em> 104.21). As Rist (1969: 247-250) has argued, Seneca regards suicide as the free act    <strong>par excellence. </strong>Liberty for Seneca exists everywhere for both the wise man and the normal man whatever the circumstances they face – at
the end of the rope, at the bottom of a cliff, at the throat, to the opening of the veins themselves, all these represent the ‘pathway to liberty’(Seneca    <em>De Ira </em>3.15).
</p>
<p>
    Rist argues that Seneca in his writing seems to endorse a negative conception of freedom that focuses not on what the agent is able to do, but rather as a
    state in which no one is forced to act (Rist 1969:249). While on the surface this would appear a valid inference to draw, I think this undervalues Seneca’s
    and Stoicism’s as a wholes stressing of the importance of self-control and self-determination. While acting in external matters largely comes under arguing
    over indifferents, and so is of secondary importance, the freedom within oneself to overcome these indifferents and the resulting urges and temptations
    they present, and to instead only value virtue itself and self-determination is the goal of the Stoic. By self-determination in this case I mean that only
    as a fully internalised concept – that is to be self-determined by being unaffected by indifferents so wholly that reason and virtue alone are the only
    motivators actually acting upon the Stoic. The Stoic for Seneca, I feel, is in fact a figure of indifference to everything <em>apart</em> from his own
    mental and moral condition, upon which he places the most value. Statements to this effect, the focus on internal virtues and complete indifference to
    external pressures, are common throughout both Seneca and the works of other Stoics. A Stoic is just as conscious of the loss of his own faculties of
    reason as external pressures; as Aurelius suggests, if a Stoic feels he is losing control over himself, and cannot stop it, it is right that he should exit
    life(Aurelius <em>Meditations </em>10.8)<em>.</em> Rist’s claim that Seneca endorses a negative conception of freedom, as we would usually understand it,
    is incomplete as the internal obstacles and pressures on the agent are as integral, if not more so for Seneca as a determiner of freedom as the external
    pressures. I would argue that suicide for Seneca is not just the escape from being forced into vice from external factors, but also from our own weakness
    of will internally. This is why suicide for Seneca has such an ennobling effect on many of the cases Seneca lists in his writings. For the Sages such as
    Cato, Zeno, Scipio and Socrates it is the ultimate summation of their sage-hood, that is to say testament to their character that they choose to end their
    lives voluntarily(Seneca <em>Ep. </em>104.21, 66.4, 70.4)<em>. </em>Whereas for those who Stoicism might count as fools, suicide when done under the right
    circumstances can be an act that is praiseworthy and elevates them to be respected, such as the gladiator mentioned earlier or the Roman politician Libo
    who, after a failed plot to take power and having suffered the ignominy of all his friends and family deserting him, restored some of his honour by taking
    his own life. He earned this honour from suicide as he demonstrated both contempt for his enemies and a triumph over his own cowardice (Seneca <em>Ep.</em>
    70). Suicide offers the ultimate freedom from all types of vice, even those of our own impulses, and this is why it appeals so greatly and holds such a
    lofty position for Seneca. Seneca’s view of freedom then is more in line with the older Stoics than Rist surmises, and certainly has elements of what we
    would in modern times consider a more positive conception of freedom, even if the emphasis generally appears to be on freedom from coercion in practise, a
    conception I will discuss further in this dissertation.
</p>
<p>
    Sevenster (1961) writes that Seneca believes that ‘freedom is incorporated<strong> </strong>into the natural order of things’ so that man can whenever he
    chooses access this freedom via the possibilities offered in nature(Sevenster 1961: 58); while I would largely agree with this, especially as Seneca
    himself posits suicide as part of the providential ordering of the universe(Seneca <em>De Prov.</em> 2.9), it is at this point very important to note that
    the rational and, for Seneca, noble suicide has various restrictions placed upon it. Seneca, and by extension I, do not want to claim that every suicide is
    rational and therefore to be praised for its own nature in exclusion. The circumstances and ultimate justifications for suicide need to be clear and
    rational, for life as an indifferent (if featuring virtue and no preponderance of vice) is still to be preferred to death.
</p>
<p>
    Seneca in Epistle 104 notes that there are many reasons a man should choose to live if he can, not least for the benefit of others such as his loved
    ones(Seneca <em>Ep. </em>104.2). The letter as a whole stresses several key positions for Seneca - that what matters is the internal state and self-control
    of the mind(Seneca <em>Ep. </em>104.4), and secondly that there are many common reasons for giving up on life that are not justified, such as the death of
loved ones, poverty or some other hardships, as it has been shown that wise men such as Cato and Socrates can endure all these and more(Seneca    <em>Ep. </em>104.5-9). An appropriate suicide then is not at the first sign of suffering or hardship, but at the point where death would be more honourable
    and free than living – it is at this point that we, just as Cato and Socrates did, should declare “allegiance to liberty in the midst of slavery” by
    removing ourselves from this existence(Seneca <em>Ep. </em>104.11). I think the key point to stress is as whereas many suicides that we generally come
    across are a result of feeling driven to suicide by desperation – the feeling that there is no other option but death for the person committing suicide as
    their life is so unbearable - often linked with a feeling of powerlessness, for the Stoic the admirable suicide is one where there is free choice: life on
    the one hand and death on the other, and neither choice is made out of desperation but by consent to reason and a clear examination of the future
    worldcourses. The choice of life by any Stoic can of course be endured, but that endurance is not necessarily good in itself, and would certainly be bad if
    it led to vice. Death on the other is an active choice made when we do not want to compromise our honour, virtue or values, and as such can be an ennobling
    choice, showing the ultimate disdain for anything but our own virtue, that of a rational triumph over our will for life at any cost. Our earlier discussion
    of worldcourses plays its part here – the justified suicide for the Stoic takes in both the view of his own virtue and the effect his death will have on
    the world and others before making a decision – all elements are weighed up calmly before he comes to his decision.
</p>
<p>
    It is perhaps of no surprise then that Seneca criticised the doctrine of ‘where there is life, there is hope’, which he contended that while maybe holding
    some truth, missed the point that “life is not to be purchased at any price”(Seneca <em>Ep </em>70.2). It is this assertion that lies at the heart of
    Seneca’s views on suicide - that it should not be enacted in haste or for just any reason, but that it remains a choice that a man should make in order to
    preserve his virtue above preserving himself for the sake of his mere existence alone. The view in its essential form is not wildly different from that
    expounded by Cicero that:
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “When a man has a preponderance of the things in accordance with nature, it is his proper function to remain alive; when he has or foresees a
        preponderance of their opposites, it is his proper function to depart from life. This clearly shows that it is sometimes a proper function both for the
        wise man to depart from life, although he is happy..
    </em>
    ” (Cicero <em>De Finibus </em>3.60). <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    The difference for Seneca is that this rational self-assessment is not only open to the wise man or sage, it is open to all men. Stoicism has often been
    attacked for the seeming inconsistency of the Stoic being able to remain happy despite any external circumstances, and its endorsement of the choice of
    suicide. However I believe the examination of the views we have just conducted squares this apparent inconsistency. While a Stoic will always aim to be
    (and the wise man arguably will be) happy no matter the circumstances, if he sees that virtue potentially being compromised by either his own decline or
    external factors beyond his control, than the option of suicide can clearly be a credible and praiseworthy choice in order to retain his virtuous and
    complete character. In fact if his character itself is under threat, it may be the only choice to ensure he remains free. The key difference for Seneca is
    that this kind of reasoning is open to everyone, not solely the wise man, and therefore, by extension, the inherent freedom that suicide can provide is
    accessible to everyone.
</p>
<p>
    Suicide then for the Stoics, and in particular Seneca has several important properties. Not only is it a potentially rational choice, it is in certain
    circumstances a choice that should be made. In a world where we are constantly under the potential coercion of others in what we do, suicide is the one
    option that affords us complete control and freedom over our actions, character and principles, it is the supreme ‘no’ that brooks no compromise, as it
    pertains to the one thing that is wholly ours – our own life. Suicide for Seneca is the ultimate act of self-respect. When your autonomy, principles or
    virtue will likely be compromised by remaining alive, it is arguably your duty to commit suicide than suffer the loss of one of those key elements. If you
    accept the Stoic position of virtue being the only good and holding the only value in life, then I believe such a position on suicide becomes undeniable.
    If not, I believe that independent of Stoic views most people would intuitively see some value in these suicides as testaments to the character of the one
    committing suicide if the suicide is rational and consistent with their core beliefs. It is just this view of suicide that I am endorsing – that suicide is
    not only acceptable, but can in the right circumstances be both ennobling and the ultimate act of freedom.

    <strong>The Right to Suicide and Suicide as a Free Act</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Two objections could be brought up that could cause potential issues for this Stoic conception of suicide hereto outlined. Firstly, as I have so far
    assumed, is whether we do actually have a right over our own life - if we are allowed to commit suicide under any circumstances. Secondly is the question
    as to whether suicide can really be considered an act of freedom in any meaningful way. As a way of modernising and supporting the Stoic view I will here
    examine more recent dialogue in these areas and see how the Stoic view with more current views.
</p>
<p>
    That we have a right to decide what happens over our own life has been argued for convincingly by a range of philosophers. The classic arguments of Aquinas
that condemned suicide as a mortal sin were famously deconstructed by Hume who justified suicide on beneficent and autonomist grounds(Hume    <em>On the Naturalness</em> <em>of Suicide </em>142-7). Building on this, a defence of a person’s right to suicide is given by Schopenhauer, who states
    clearly that there is ‘nothing in the world to which every man has an unassailable title than to his own life’(Schopenhauer <em>On Suicide: </em>1). Though
    Schopenhauer due to his own philosophical views believed suicide to be in many ways a mistake, he still sees it as a fundamental choice that is open to
    anyone and that should be respected, and even in some cases states there should be some appreciation for the courage of the individual in taking his own
    life(Schopenhauer <em>On Suicide: </em>1).
</p>
<p>
    Battin (1994) sets out a rather more detailed argument to support the claim that suicide is not just a liberty right of the sort outlined by Mill(Mill
    1859), but a fundamental human right, on equal footing as the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Battin, to give a brief overview,
    proposes the concept of fundamental human rights as the right to do certain things if those things are constitutive of human dignity(Battin 1994: 280);
    this in addition to and coming before any liberty rights we may have. Whereas the right to freedom we see as constitutive of basic human dignity, other
    rights, like that of being an alcoholic, while they may consist of liberty rights as long as they harm no others, cannot be viewed as fundamental human
    rights. Battin develops this to make the controversial claim that while these rights as constituents of human dignity are equally constituent of dignity
    for all, the right to them is not equally distributed, as suicide shows. The reason for this step is so Battin can rationalise why in some cases we feel
    someone has a right to suicide, and sometimes, in the case of suicide from a momentary depression, violent intent, or as the product of clearly false
    beliefs, they do not. What we must judge suicides on then is whether they are constitutive to human dignity or not.
</p>
<p>
    The first objection to this would be to state that no suicides can be constitutive to human dignity - that they are by definition an affront to human
    dignity. To disarm this we only need a case of someone whose dignity is improved or contributed to by them being able to end their own life. First we have
    someone who is commanded to do a grave immoral act, such as the rape of a woman in a civil war, but who chooses to commit suicide rather than perform such
    an act. If he did perform the act he would have degraded both his own dignity and that of the person he was raping, violating her fundamental rights.
    Clearly then if it is the only other option, suicide is more constitutive of his human dignity in these circumstances than performing the act. Second, a
    perhaps less controversial example is that of someone who is suffering from a terminal illness which they know will make them gradually lose control of
    their faculties, bowels, and eventually their mind and memory itself. If they prefer to die rather than face this slow and inevitable degradation is it
    not, if admittedly only in a somewhat negative sense, constitutive of their dignity to avoid the potential indignity of a long suffering and miserable
    illness? I would argue that holding someone to such a fate unnecessarily and against their will is a clear violation of their human dignity, and by
    extension their fundamental rights. A third case could be those, such as the Buddhist monks mentioned earlier or the Stoic suicides of the likes of Cato,
    where they commit suicide as a protest and representation of their political or moral beliefs. Such suicides when enacted in full appreciation of the
    potential beneficent impact and the full cost to the one and others of committing suicide, and when enacted in accordance with their fundamental beliefs
    and convictions, the act of committing suicide becomes a testament to their character and arguably an aspect and enhancement of their fundamental human
    dignity.
</p>
<p>
    With that objection apparently dispelled through these cases the next objection would be to question what we really mean when we speak of human dignity?
    Battin's definition, which I concur with, is two-fold; firstly is the idea that all human beings have an inherent dignity, an intrinsic worth(Battin 1994:
    282), and the second a more empirical conception, where human dignity consists in parts, though perhaps not exclusively, of autonomy in terms of external
    events, self-determination, and responsibility for one's acts, as well as self-expressivness and self-respect(Skinner 1991). Given such a definition it is
    clear how other fundamental rights such as the right to freedom are related directly to human dignity. Battin uses this definition to distinguish between
    suicides that seem to have an appreciation of and act as an endorsement of these values, and what she terms violent suicides - those that show no regard or
    even a disregard for these elements of human dignity so defined(Battin 1994: 282-4). Though I endorse these conceptions as far as they go, for the Stoic
    position I am supporting a clearer distinction is easily made, based on our earlier arguments – that of the rational suicide and irrational suicide. For
    the Stoic position it comes down to a moral judgement, the morally right suicide being the rational, and the morally wrong suicide being the irrational.
    What the Stoic position values in human dignity is largely the same – the ultimate responsibility for our actions, our self-determination and perhaps most
    of all the factor of self-respect. That final term is perhaps the most key of all, as the rational suicides of the Stoics are most of all self-respecting;
    they show an appreciation for their own moral character, their own autonomy and faculties, and make their rational decision based on the realistic future
    worldcourses<a href="file:///C:/Users/nick.falkowski/Google%20Drive/essays/Masters%20Dissertation.docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Battin's
    argument is useful for the Stoic position as espoused by Seneca as it makes it clear why we have a right to end our lives as much as we have a right to
    anything - because it is a constituent of our inherent human dignity.
</p>
<p>
    A related concern is that of whether suicide as an act represents a type of freedom in any meaningful sense. Under the influential definitions outlined by
Berlin (1969) of positive and negative liberty    <a href="file:///C:/Users/nick.falkowski/Google%20Drive/essays/Masters%20Dissertation.docx#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, given their views on
    suicide it is at first unclear where the position of the likes of Seneca would fall. I should make it clear I am not here entering into the debate on what
    sort of freedom is necessary for moral responsibility, or the apparently paradoxical views of Stoicism’s strict determinism and moral culpability and
    freedom of agents. As has been pointed out by Bobzien (1997), the Stoics and ancient Greek and Roman philosophers in general thought of freedom in very
    different terms than the modern arguments(Bobzien 1997: 71-13). Instead I will be focusing on whether the position that suicide can count as an act of true
    freedom is defensible, and how.
</p>
<p>
    Rist (1969) feels Seneca’s endorsement of suicide as an act of freedom construes an assumption of negative freedom as the defining characteristic of
    freedom, but I have argued previously against that point as potentially an oversimplification of Seneca’s viewpoint. Under the negative conception of
    freedom a person’s freedom is the result, or lack thereof, of restraints placed upon the agent on what they can do in terms of carrying out their
    decisions, with the person and their reasoning and functioning not taken into account when working out their resulting freedom (Berlin 1969, Christman
    1991). However for Stoicism the reasoning and functioning of the agent are clearly a very constituent part of that agent’s freedom, one only needs to
    relate the famous Stoic paradox given by Cicero ‘That only the wise man is free and every fool is a slave’ (Cicero <em>Stoic Paradoxes </em>4) to see that
    the reasoning capacity of the agent is essential to the Stoic conception of freedom and autonomy in these terms. Therefore the association of freedom as
    not just freedom from restraint but also with it self-governance and self-mastery, a positive conception of freedom, is I feel where the Stoic position
    would rest.
</p>
<p>
    The specific conception of positive freedom that I will endorse as compatible for this neo-Stoic view, and one that avoids many of the traditional
    objections against positive liberty, is that given by Christman (1991) that stresses the formation of a person’s character and the resultant desires and
    decisions they wish to carry out, and their ability to do so, as the key determiners of an individual’s freedom(Christman 1991: 345-6). Christman maintains
    that for someone’s desires to be free they have to be the product of rational reflection on all the options, while they are unfree if they are the product
    of any manipulation, indoctrination or deceit. What matters then is the formation and content of the agent’s desires and their ability to realise them.
</p>
<p>
    If we now take this conception and apply it to the Stoic act of rational suicide, we find that a justified suicide will also correspond with a free act
    under this account of positive freedom. The Stoic suicide is by definition taken on rational reflection with a view on all possible outcomes and
    worldcourses, and is taken out of a desire to preserve something that is valued intrinsically and consistently by the agent – their autonomy in cases of
    mental or physical deterioration, or their moral character and values in cases where that has come under pressure from external causes or internal
    temptations that cannot by normal means be overcome. The open and rational choice of freedom is not only consistent as a free act for the Stoic’s
    character, but also offers the Stoic a freedom unavailable to most men who would abhor suicide. For, while a normal man may be coerced into doing one thing
    or another on threat of harm or injury or even death, leading to them either committing an act against their will or being killed against their will, by
    embracing suicide freely as an alternative the Stoic has ensured that even in his exit from the world he has remained free and rational. The follower of
    the Stoic view has open to him the ultimate ‘no’, the denial of all other outcomes that suicide represents, but by taking the decision consistently with
    his desires and character he is preserving his freedom in a positive sense. Even if the act can be viewed as in essence a refusal, it represents more than
    that. Therefore I would argue that here defined suicide can be a genuine act of freedom for the rational person, even if it prevents their ability to act
    freely in the future. It is this finality that gives suicide the defining quality it can have over how well a life has been lived, as it shows an
    appreciation for freedom, autonomy and virtue as the ultimate priorities whose value cannot be equalled.

    <strong>Spinoza and the Impossibility of Suicide </strong>
</p>
<p>
    So far then I have defined suicide, justified its rationality, and given the Stoic position with reference to more modern thinking on rights and freedom,
    from which I believe a consistent position has emerged. All this discussion so far however will prove fruitless if we are convinced by a classic argument
    from Spinoza that states quite strikingly that the very concept of suicide itself is impossible. It is this objection I will now examine.
</p>
<p>
    Much work has been done between the links between ancient Stoic philosophy and the works of Spinoza, and Spinoza is thought to have drawn a large influence
    from Stoicism(Wolfson 1934, James 1993, DeBrabander 2007). One area that Spinoza is thought to differ wildly from the views of the Stoics though is in his
    treatment of suicide. Interestingly in his work, unlike most philosophers of the period, Spinoza does not look to make a value or moral judgement on
    suicide directly, instead he questions the very possibility of suicide at all. In this section I shall examine the treatment of suicide within Spinoza and
    his argument that suicide is impossible, and suggest a possible reinterpretation of his views with reference to Stoicism, that rather than arguing against
    the Stoic view of suicide, Spinoza could be argued to have more sympathy with the Stoic than usually thought.
</p>
<p>
    The issue of suicide crops up several times in Spinoza’s writing but perhaps most fully in The Ethics 4P20S, which states: “No one, therefore, unless he is
    defeated by causes external, and contrary, to his nature, neglects to seek his own advantage, <em>or </em>to preserve his being. No one, I say, avoids food
or kills himself from the necessity of his own nature.”(Spinoza E4P20S    <a href="file:///C:/Users/nick.falkowski/Google%20Drive/essays/Masters%20Dissertation.docx#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>). Just as for the
    Stoics, reason and nature are inextricably and importantly linked for Spinoza, and so Spinoza’s claim appears to be that the very concept of suicide stands
    in opposition to proper human nature. Spinoza later reinforces this claim by stating that for a man to strive not to exist from the necessity of his own
    nature is as impossible as that something should come from nothing(E4P20S). Suicide then for Spinoza is by definition impossible, as it stands contrary to
    human nature. He is seemingly not making a moral judgement on suicide here, he is saying that the concept of suicide itself is effectively impossible.
</p>
<p>
    Obvious objections arise to this but first, as Miller(2005) explains, it is worth considering what Spinoza means when he says suicide is impossible. For
    Spinoza, Miller argues, suicide is not a case of epistemic type of impossibility, but a ‘nomological impossibility’. Natural laws are taken by Spinoza in
    this instance to be universal and necessitating so that whatever is the case is exclusively the case within them - possibility becomes what is literally
    possible, not theoretically possible, given the framework of nature and natural laws(Miller 2005: 19, Mason 1986: 325-6). Suicide for Spinoza breaks the
    laws of nature and since breaking a law of nature is literally impossible, suicide is impossible.
</p>
<p>
    We witness suicide with relative regularity in our present lives, and history is littered with examples of apparent suicides, so how can Spinoza say
suicide is impossible? The answer hinges on the fact that for Spinoza no-one can commit suicide due to the <em>necessity of his own nature</em>    <em>alone</em>(Spinoza E4P20S). According to Spinoza what we generally see as suicides are in fact not due to the internal nature of the person committing
    suicide, but are always due to external factors acting upon that person(Spinoza E4P20S). Spinoza lists a range of examples for such deaths, from someone
    who is forced to stab himself by being physically overpowered, to the death of Seneca - whereupon a tyrant orders him to kill himself or face death by the
    hands of others, or finally the rather stranger concept of killing oneself “because hidden external causes so dispose his imagination, and so affect his
    Body, that it takes on another nature, contrary to the former, a nature of which there cannot be an idea in the Mind”(Spinoza E4P20S). This emphasis on the
    external is supported by an earlier passage which states that “those who kill themselves are weak-minded and completely conquered by external causes
    contrary to their nature”(Spinoza E4P18S). Spinoza’s position appears to be that what we generally think of as suicides are not in any way caused by the
    internal nature of the person committing suicide, but wholly by the pressure of external forces which overcome and subjugate the internal nature and desire
    for self-preservation of the person committing suicide.
</p>
<p>
It is not hard to draw, as suggested by Miller, that though not directly ever mentioned in conjunction with suicide, Spinoza’s principle of    <em>conatus, </em>which is ‘each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to preserve its own being’(Spinoza E3P6), has a strong relevance to the
    apparent impossibility of suicide. It is similarly related that this striving to be is in the essential essence of the thing, and that this striving is
    maintained for a continual and indefinite amount of time(Spinoza E3P7-8). Clearly if we take this as an essential law of the nature of beings, which are by
    definition unbreakable, then we can see why Spinoza could believe suicide to be impossible.
</p>
<p>
    There are two strands of argument I want to now look at. Firstly, supposing we accept as Miller does that Spinoza believes suicide as he has defined it to
    actually be impossible, I will present an argument that finds fault with this reasoning. Secondly, there are some other writings by Spinoza that could
    potentially cast doubt on whether his conception is really as different to the Stoic’s beliefs on suicide as Miller believes it is, which I will discuss
    following this.
</p>
<p>
    Returning to the list of apparent suicides Spinoza gives in E4P20S, the first, that of someone literally forcing your hand to stab yourself, would not
    intuitively be called a suicide and based on the definition of suicide I established earlier, would not count as it is not willed by the agent; therefore
    this can be dismissed as a non-example.
</p>
<p>
    The second example, death such as that of Seneca, is more problematic. I would suggest the deaths of several other Stoics such as Zeno and Cato would
    potentially be even more problematic for Spinoza, but let us first look at Seneca. Bennett (1984) points out that when Seneca killed himself his body was
    not transmitting any forces from the outside. His decision to kill himself was a combination of his nature that flowed from his strengths and frailties at
    the time, and the potential knowledge that if he didn’t kill himself at that moment, he would face a worse death in the morning – as caused by a letter
    from Nero to this effect. Even though the letter from Nero is an external cause, his knowledge of it was still a facet of his nature which, combined with
    all the other elements affecting his nature such as his wish for dignity and a good reputation, motivated him to take his own life. Whereas Spinoza stated
    that no thing can be destroyed except through an external cause(Spinoza E3P4), Bennett argues that Seneca’s death falsifies this(Bennett 1984: 238).
</p>
<p>
    Another example I would propose that is even more striking is that of the death of Cato of Utica as related by Plutarch, Cicero, Seneca and others. At his
    death Cato was the last leader of the republican forces at the North African city of Utica. Caesar’s legions were advancing upon the town and Cato’s forces
    were hopelessly outnumbered and rather than fight, Cato, the day before Caesar was due to arrive, ordered all his forces to disband and return to their
    homes while he remained. That night, before Caesar arrived, he had one last meal with his friends and discussed the philosophical idea that ‘only the good
    man could truly be free’, before retiring to bed to read the Phaedo. After finishing he proceeded to stab himself with the aim of killing himself, but due
    to an injured hand he failed at the task and his friends found him before he died and bandaged him up. However such was his wish to die that he tore open
his own bandages and ripped out his own intestines, killing himself, remarking “Now I am my own master”(all this description is taken from Plutatch    <em>Life Of Cato</em> <em>Minor </em>69-71).
</p>
<p>
    This shows Cato saw his own death as purely his own decision and in line with his own nature, and his long evening of meditation on philosophy before his
    act certainly suggests this was no rash action. An additional point of key importance is unlike Seneca, Cato had no reason to expect death when Caesar
    arrived; in fact Caesar has made it his policy to grant clemency to all his opponents in the war, and allow them to even return to the senate and be a
    significant influence on Roman affairs. In fact Caesar is said to have remarked "O Cato, I begrudge thee thy death; for thou didst begrudge me the sparing
    of thy life."(Plutarch <em>Life Of Cato Minor </em>72.2); clearly Cato’s life was under no immediate threat. Likewise Cato hardly seems to characterise
    someone who is completely conquered by external causes or could be described as weak minded as Spinoza says all those who kill themselves are(Spinoza
    E4P18S). Firstly, Cato has endured years of civil war, crossed the North African desert and endured the deaths of countless friends and the dismantlement
    of his beloved republic. Secondly, his whole life up to this point had been one of self-determination, and dogged, even famed adherence to Stoic
    philosophy. Certainly contemporary sources seem to insist he embodied the opposite of weak-mindedness - the steadfastness of his character is near
    legendary. Thirdly the character of his death seems to have been an attempt to retain his freedom, his honour, and to die according to his principles.
    Surely it would be hard to argue, especially lacking overt external causes, that his death was anything but consistent with his internal nature and
    character. If Seneca’s death can be argued by Bennett as a refutation of Spinoza’s argument, than I feel Cato’s death can be said to refute it
    conclusively.
</p>
<p>
    How could Spinoza respond then? Well a potential response could claim that we are misunderstanding what Spinoza means when he speaks of nature, or that the
    death of Cato would fall under the third bracket of self-killings, wherein hidden external causes affect the imagination and body of an individual to alter
    his nature from the natural one, leading him to kill himself (Spinoza E4P20S). This statement is vague but there are certain readings that could make it
    understandable – it could be a case of physical or mental illness that alters the mind, such as depression or a physical disease that causes a loss of
    cognitive faculties, or even external drugs that can change a person’s chemical makeup, either temporarily or permanently. These all seem reasonable
    enough, but I find that any readings beyond these three are hard to support, while they also do not help us in the death of Cato who was not obviously
    suffering from any of these when he choose to commit suicide. I suppose this point could be debated but without more evidence I would suggest such a
    discussion would be fruitless - we have to go on the accounts we do have, which corroborate that Cato’s death seemed very much consistent with his
    character and internal nature and not due to any new external forces.
</p>
<p>
    Gabhart (1999) raises a related concern that even if we do take this third type of self-killing as an explanation for these cases, it becomes unclear under
    Spinoza’s wider position what the distinction between suicide and any other kind of death is at all. To say that someone commits suicide under the third
    heading is for Spinoza seemingly to say that they, due to an external cause, took on a radically different nature then they had before. Spinoza’s
    background metaphysics states that all finite modes go under constant change(Spinoza E2 ax.4), whereas all existence and striving is by its nature going to
    be overcome at some point by external factors. As Gabhart puts it:
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        “When the ratio of internal motion of the parts of the body is altered beyond a relatively fixed proportion, the body's nature - - a finite mode
        constituted by its component finite modes as a particular complex individual-- changes. This change we call death. Given Spinoza's mind-body
        correlativity thesis (see E2P7 and E3P1 as particularly relevant here), the decrease of the body's power of maintaining its constituent ratio of motion
        that characterizes its physical individuality necessarily involves a decrease in the power of the mind to posit its own existence.”
    </em>
    (Gabhart 1999: 625)
</p>
<p>
    That is to say all death involves a change in something’s fundamental physical and mental nature, making the distinction between what would be a suicide as
    compared to a normal death unclear if we take this third definition of suicides to mean external causes that cause a fundamental change in nature – all
    death/dying would seem to do this under Spinoza’s terms.
</p>
<p>
    These problems being noted I do not believe Spinoza gives a sufficient account of the suicides of the likes of Cato as being distinct and in opposition to
    Cato’s nature.
</p>
<p>
    In discussing the Stoics and Spionza, Miller concludes ‘it is clear that the Stoics and Spinoza thought differently about suicide’, noting that though
    there may be much ground upon which they would agree, they differ hugely on the primacy of self-preservation, which Spinoza considers unrevisable whereas
    the Stoics do not(Miller 2005:25). However I believe if we question and examine just what Spinoza means when he uses the term ‘being’, then it throws the
    apparent impossibility of suicide as we would generally understand into question. It is clear that Spinoza believes in the naturalness of the concept that
    “everyone should strive to preserve his own being as far as he can”(Spinoza E4P18S). Up to this point we have taken that conception of ‘being’ as to be one
    and the same with someone’s corporeal existence, which death naturally ends, and if we accept that it is in one’s nature to want to extend that being, then
    the argument that suicide is impossible from someone’s own nature alone holds up. But what if we consider that rather than merely referring to their life
    as their ‘being’, Spinoza is referring to far more than that, that what actually defines a being is not just their physical existence but their inherent
    character, their beliefs, their principles – namely that which makes them who they are.
</p>
<p>
    If we are to strip away from someone all their beliefs, principles, attitudes and knowledge of themselves, I would suggest it is hard to say what remains
    of the person except their life itself – has their being as essentially understood really been preserved in any meaningful sense? Is it natural to want
    life so much that all these should be willingly compromised? Is life to be bought at any price? I would suggest not. Spinoza if taken at face value seems
    to suggest this – but if he, when he speaks of preserving a ‘being’, is using the more Stoic concept of a composite creature, of whose corporeal existence
    is only a part of their whole being, than perhaps he is saying something else entirely. What he is referring to as suicide becomes something different to
    what Cato committed, suicide for Spinoza may well be the refutation of not the will to live per se, but the will to live on as yourself, as the same
    coherent ‘being’. Cato arguably wanted so much to maintain the opinions, principles and beliefs that constituted his being as much as his existence itself,
    that he choose to end his physical existence rather than sacrifice what would be a core part of what makes him himself.
</p>
<p>
    I admit that this could be seen as a stretch but the Stoic influence on Spinoza's work is well known and there is evidence to support such a view. Firstly
    returning again to E4P18S Spinoza makes a few statements here that are of particular interest:
</p>
<p>
    <em>“reason demands nothing contrary to nature, it demands that everyone love himself,</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>seek his own advantage, what is really useful to him, want what will really lead man</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>to a greater perfection, and absolutely, that everyone should strive to preserve his own</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>being as far as he can. This, indeed, is as necessarily true as that the whole is greater</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>than its part...”(Spinoza E4P18S)</em>
</p>
<p>
    There are many elements of this section that both echo Stoicism and that could potentially lend support for my proposal. The 'reason demanding nothing
    contrary to nature' is an echo of Stoicism, who likewise saw in the sort of rational suicides we have discussed nothing contrary with nature in them, in
    fact quite the opposite. Secondly the desire to achieve perfection harks back to the Stoic desire to become a sage, or as sage-like as possible. My point
    would also be whether someone could feasibly love themselves for themselves, and seek their own advantage while being willing to compromise a core part of
    themselves such as their fundamental principles and beliefs just to continue their existence? I would argue there is an inherent contradiction there unless
    you take what constitutes themselves to only be their bodily matter and nothing else – that their opinions and intrinsic character have no bearing on who
    they really are, which I would suggest is a controversial and unappealing proposition. Second is the statement that the agent should preserve his being 'as
    far as he can' suggesting there may be a point where it would become impossible to preserve his own being. True this could merely mean until physical
    ailments overcome him but I would suggest it could also be taken to mean that there could be a point where preserving his 'being' as we defined it – a
    composite of his corporeal existence and his principles and beliefs, could be impossible so that one must be chosen to be preserved, even if it is at the
    expense of the other. The suggestion that the ‘whole is greater’ than the part directly after this lends potential credence to this conception of 'being'
    as consisting of more than just one's physical existence for Spinoza.
</p>
<p>
    Building on this is E4P72 that states a 'free man always acts honestly, not deceptively' and in the Scholium to this section Spinoza expands by giving the
    example of a man who could escape from death by treachery, and stating that 'would not the principle of preserving his own being recommend, without
    qualification, that he be treasonous?' before dismissing such a notion as 'absurd'(Spinoza E4P72S). The implication here is that self-preservation of at
    least the physical body is not always of primary importance – clearly maintaining one's honesty by dying rather than saving oneself through deception is
    recommended by this passage. If we stick to the suggestion of someone's 'being' for Spinoza as being one and the same as their life – their corporeal
    existence – then this passage appears to present a huge problem for Spinoza's specific position that suicide is impossible, and for his larger position as
    a whole, as to die rather than be deceptive would seem to be part of one’s natural ideal.
</p>
<p>
    However if, as I have suggested, Spinoza is referring to 'being' as a composite of both physical existence and someone's moral character then the problem
    does not occur. For the Catos of the world who value their entire 'being', their principles are as much part of them as their physical form, which they
    values so highly that they would sometimes rather end the latter than compromise the former. They are arguably by doing this still striving to preserve
    their own being as far as they can, and for Spinoza's definition would not qualify as a suicide as they are not striving to end their own 'being' per se,
    but in fact valuing it so highly that they are living in accordance with their nature by refusing to compromise an essential part of their being by living
    on and being unvirtuous.
</p>
<p>
    To elucidate this point we have Letter 23 within which suicide is used as a reductio ad absurdum example by Spinoza in order to answer the question 'if
    there was a person for whom baseness was natural, would they ever do good?'(Spinoza <em>Letter 2</em>3)<em>.</em> Spinoza sees the situation as analogous
    to suicide as it is for him by definition impossible. Spinoza states that rationally if there was a person who could 'live better on the gallows than at
    his table' then he would be foolish not to hang himself(Spinoza <em>Letter 23</em>), but goes on to say that such a person could never by definition exist.
    This has traditionally been used to add weight to the suggestion that Spinoza believes someone who wants to commit suicide from their nature is impossible,
    as would seem the obvious interpretation. However what I would suggest Spinoza really is imagining here is someone who so devalues their essential 'being'
    that death would be preferable by their intrinsic nature alone, without any consultation to reason. I would say for Spinoza it is the impossibility of
    someone ever being better off not valuing their 'being' as a whole that is impossible/against nature here, not the fact that they could choose to die. What
    I mean to say is I propose that what Spinoza means by suicide is the negation of 'wanting to be' based purely on that person's nature. It is this and not
    that one might to choose to end his life consistently with his nature in order to preserve his greater 'being' that Spinoza is referring to. Thus for him
    under this argument the deaths of Cato and similar cases would not be viewed as suicides.
</p>
<p>
    I will admit at this point that this argument draws a lot of inferences, and if true, could create some greater problems for Spinoza’s philosophy as a
    whole. But either Spinoza means something different from what we generally mean by ‘being’ and ‘suicide’ - which would mean the type of suicides we are
    discussing are exempt from Spinoza’s definition and thus no claim is made to their impossibility, or we have to ignore the writing of E4P73S and accept
    that Spinoza does view all suicides as impossible and contrary to nature. Such a second position I feel does not answer the examples of the deaths of the
    like of Cato adequately, or even if we grant it did do so under the third definition of self-killing given in E4P20S<strong> </strong>then it still is
    unclear, as Gabhart has argued, how we can differentiate a self-killing from any kind of natural death.
</p>
<p>
    The argument I would like to propose is that Spinoza would identify the sort of rational Stoic suicide we are presenting as acceptable as an attempt on the
    part of the person committing suicide to preserve their intrinsic being. Such a conception, rather than oppose the very notion of suicide, endorses the
    Stoic position we have presented. Spinoza thus understood would have seen the self-respecting Stoic suicides we have discussed as natural, forming as they
    do an endorsement of their striving to ‘be’, consistent with their intrinsic character and nature.

    <strong>Conclusion </strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
We have from these arguments arrived at an updated view of the Stoic position on suicide. A suicide has been defined as being a death that is fully    <em> intended</em> by the agent, <em>caused directly</em> by actions of the agent and that the agent believes <em>will result </em>in death. I have shown
    suicidal considerations not to be pathological, and a rational suicide has been shown to be possible in cases where the person wishing to commit suicide
    does not hold any relevant false beliefs relating to their situation or the act of suicide, acts in accordance with their beliefs and character, and has a
    reasonable view on the various potential worldcourses that might result from either the cessation or continuation of their existence.
</p>
<p>
    Not only has the concept of rational suicide been shown to be possible, both in theory and in practise by various examples, it has also been contended that
    it can be considered a fundamental human right as it has been shown to be conducive directly to human dignity as much as other basic fundamental rights
    like the right to life or liberty.
</p>
<p>
    The Stoic position hereto advanced has the conclusion that not only is suicide morally acceptable, but that it can also be morally praiseworthy and
    advisable in cases where the motivation is self-respecting – a suicide to retain virtue, character or autonomy. This assertion is not made without
    qualification; certainly many suicides such as the ‘violent’ suicides previously discussed and commonly encountered do not fit this, and are to be
    regretted. But those suicides that are undertaken under the schema of rationality we have outlined should be praised for their self-respecting nature and
    the strength of character demonstrated by them. With this we have argued that suicide can not only be a morally praiseworthy assertion of character, it can
    be an ennobling assertion of freedom, the ultimate ‘no’ that when undertaken rationally and freely can be argued as the ultimate triumph of character over
    adversity. If we hold the Stoic views on the value of virtue, and that the quality of a life as more important than its quantity, I do not see how one
    could find disagreement still with these types of suicide. For the vast majority who do not hold those Stoic positions, the point may be less convincing,
    and certainly not beyond refutation, but I would maintain that the core assertion that certain suicides can both be rational and praise-worthy still rings
    true. The accusation will surely come that this argument glorifies suicide to an extent, and though this may be justified the point remains that my
    argument has shown that a position can be taken consistently and successfully that makes certain types of suicide not just rational or morally permissible,
    as most modern arguments contend, but morally praiseworthy. The view of suicide passed down by Seneca and the Stoics and outlined here cannot be overlooked
    if we do indeed really value concepts such as autonomy, self-respect, self-mastery and human dignity.
